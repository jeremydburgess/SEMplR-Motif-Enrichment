\title{Select the most common TSS per gene (without tie-breaking)}
\usage{
helper_selectCommonTSS(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame or tibble with at least these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{entrez}    : gene identifiers
\item \code{tss}       : numeric transcription start sites
\item \code{tx_strand} : strand (“+” or “–”)
}}
}
\value{
A tibble containing one or more rows per \code{entrez}, each
TSS having the highest observed frequency for that gene.
}
\description{
\code{helper_selectCommonTSS()} takes a data frame of transcript start
sites and returns, for each gene (\code{entrez}), \strong{all} TSS values that
occur at the maximal frequency.  Tie-breaking (e.g. picking a single
5′-most TSS) is intentionally \strong{not} performed here and can be applied
separately downstream.
}
\details{
This helper does:
\enumerate{
\item Count how many times each \code{tss} appears per \code{entrez}.
\item Keep only those \code{tss} where \code{freq == max(freq)}.
\item Re-join any additional columns (e.g.\ \code{tx_strand}, transcript IDs).
}

It does \emph{not} resolve ties when multiple TSS share the same maximal
frequency; that can be handled later (e.g.\ picking the 5′-most).
