\title{Reduce overlapping ranges within each gene}
\usage{
helper_reduceOverlapsWithinGenes(gr, overlapMinGap = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A \code{GRanges} object containing promoter ranges with an \code{entrez} metadata column.}

\item{overlapMinGap}{Integer(1); the \code{min.gapwidth} argument passed to \code{reduceMC()} (default 0).}
}
\value{
A \code{GRanges} object of reduced promoter windows, where overlaps are merged only within each gene,
preserving all metadata columns.
}
\description{
Performs a two-step reduction of genomic ranges grouped by gene:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item A global reduction across all ranges using \code{extraChIPs::reduceMC()} to quickly identify
any promoter windows that merge across different genes.
\item A per-gene reduction for only those genes whose windows were merged in the global pass,
by subsetting the original ranges, splitting by gene ID, and running \code{reduceMC()} on each subset.
}
